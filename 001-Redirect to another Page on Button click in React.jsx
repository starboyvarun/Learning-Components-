//To redirect to another page on button click in a React application using MUI (Material-UI),
//you can use the Link component from React Router and wrap it around the MUI Button component.
//Here's an example code snippet:


import React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import Button from '@mui/material/Button';

const MyButton = () => {
return (
<Link to="/path-to-redirect">
<Button variant="contained" color="primary">
       Click to Redirect
</Button>
</Link>
 );
};

export default MyButton;

//Make sure to import the Link component from React Router and wrap it around the MUI Button component.
//The to prop of the Link component takes the path of the page you want to redirect to.
//Also, ensure that you have set up React Router properly in your application and defined the route for the path you want to redirect to.
